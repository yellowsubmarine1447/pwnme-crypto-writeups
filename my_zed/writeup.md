To be honest, I'm really not sure why this is even a challenge.

The flag is encrypted with some a "layered" encryption - we don't need to know the details too heavily, only that:
  - the password hash is used as the key to encrypt
  - we're given the password hash...
  - and the decrypt function is provided to us.......
  - so after modifying the module a bit we can just call decrypt.............
